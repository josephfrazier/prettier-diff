# TODO

* Consider using this prettier fork: https://github.com/arijs/prettier-miscellaneous
  * It's got some extra options that might be nice
* Add a --no-fancy option for plain text output
  * Note that the output wouldn't apply as a patch, but could be useful for pasting into plain text mediums
* Try different line lengths to minimize diff size, since wrapping can produces non-semantic diffs
