# TODO

* Use diff-so-fancy? https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy
* Consider handling JSON diffs: see https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/322
  * with https://github.com/lydell/json-stringify-pretty-compact
  * with https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-align
* Use a JS diff lib instead of shelling out to git?
  * This might seem cleaner, but then it wouldn't honor the user's git diff config
