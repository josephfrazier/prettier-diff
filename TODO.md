# TODO

* Sort CLI arguments to put options first
  * `git` is a stickler about it, and `thefuck` doesn't understand prettier-diff
* Preprocess Markdown by putting each sentence on its own line.
  * https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4642395
* Figure out if it's possible to support `prettier-diff --no-index`
* Consider using this prettier fork: https://github.com/arijs/prettier-miscellaneous
  * It's got some extra options that might be nice
